# mobile-app-starter

### What Is This?
This is a sample mobile app that lets us practice setting up React Native apps for the first time. Since it has minimal dependencies and little functionality, we can avoid running into common issues and just focus on the basics: compiling and running the app.

### How Do I Set It Up?
1. Clone this repo locally.
2. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Navigate to the repo in your terminal.
4. Install expo globally with `npm i -g expo-cli`
5. In the repo, run `npm i` to install the required dependencies
6. Run the app with `yarn ios`
